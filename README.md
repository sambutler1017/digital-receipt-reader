Digital Receipt Reader - 2021
===========================================

<h2>Description</h2>

We are proposing an NFC powered digital receipt system that will transfer receipts from a store’s point of sale (POS) system to a customer’s mobile app at checkout. The system will consist of two Raspberry Pis, an NFC reader, and a mobile app to store receipts.
